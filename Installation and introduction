ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Install Required Tools

You need a server environment to run PHP code.

 Install XAMPP
ðŸ‘‰ These come with Apache (server), MySQL (database), and PHP already configured.

Download XAMPP

Install and start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Create Your First PHP File
Go to the htdocs folder inside XAMPP (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows).
Create a folder (e.g., myproject).
Inside it, create a file index.php with this content:

<?php
echo "Hello, PHP! This is my first program.";
?>

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Run Your PHP Code
Open your browser and visit:
http://localhost/myproject/index.php


You should see:
Hello, PHP! This is my first program.
